# Data Pipeline for Spotify Data Analysis with AWS and Snowflake
![Screenshot 2024-06-17 at 8 41 05â€¯PM-Photoroom](https://github.com/Boxydaa/Spotify_pipeline/assets/152782315/ec42727c-bcd2-42a5-9848-02153731a0dc)

# Architecture Overview
The data pipeline for Spotify data analysis involves the following components:

Data Source: Spotify API
Cloud Storage: Amazon S3 Buckets (Raw and Transformed Data)
Data Processing: AWS Lambda Functions
Scheduling: Amazon CloudWatch
Data Warehouse: Snowflake
Data Analysis Tool (Optional): ChatGPT (or any other analytics tool)
# Pipeline Steps
1. Data Extraction
Trigger: A Lambda function is triggered daily by a CloudWatch event.
Process:
The Lambda function connects to the Spotify API and extracts relevant data.
The extracted data is stored in a designated S3 bucket in its raw format.
2. Data Transformation
Trigger: Another Lambda function is triggered upon the arrival of new data in the raw data S3 bucket. This can be achieved using S3 event notifications.
Process:
The Lambda function retrieves the raw data from the S3 bucket.
The data is transformed into a format suitable for analysis (e.g., denormalization, feature engineering).
The transformed data is stored in a separate S3 bucket for processed data.
3. Data Loading
Process: The transformed data in the S3 bucket is loaded into a Snowflake data warehouse.
This can be achieved using tools like AWS Glue, Snowpipe, or a custom script.
4. Data Analysis
Process: An external tool like ChatGPT or any other analytics platform can access and analyze the data stored in Snowflake.
# Benefits
Automation: The pipeline automates data extraction, transformation, and loading, reducing manual effort and ensuring timely data availability.
Scalability: The cloud-based architecture allows for easy scaling to accommodate growing data volumes.
Flexibility: Lambda functions enable customization of data processing logic.
Implementation Details
API Credentials: Securely store and manage API credentials using AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
Data Schema Definitions: Define the schema for raw and transformed data, ensuring compatibility with Snowflake's data warehouse schema.
Transformation Logic: Implement transformation logic within Lambda functions to process raw data into a suitable format for analysis.
Security: Apply security best practices such as using IAM roles for Lambda functions, encrypting data at rest and in transit, and setting up proper access controls for S3 buckets and Snowflake.
